The project looks interesting, but I would also ask you to add one
more twist. Once you have the basic emulation in place, create a
variant where the CPU has a two-stage pipeline (i.e., fetch/decode
followed by execute/writeback). I do not know if there is any
literature on this, and so you are free to design something
appropriate.
